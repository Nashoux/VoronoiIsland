To use the voronoi Island : 

-Place the fbx Folder somewhere accessible.
-Use Maya 2018/2019.
-Load the script in Maya and Run it. 
-Add Parameter to your island and don't forget to add the fbxFolder path to have the 3d object on your island. (You can replace them by add new fbx and change the name to match with older fbx)
-Then Generate !

Warning : 	-Use \ for your path or //
		-The "regenarate" is not implemented yet.
		-Only one Island at a time.

There is a little extra withe a Unity build with the fbx assets on an island ! :
